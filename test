Based on the process you've shared in the image regarding the Company Enrollment Onboarding using the TTS-Boarding File Generator, here's how you can define the Business Value and Acceptance Criteria for this feature in your Rally Board.

✅ Business Value
Implementing an automated and streamlined Company Enrollment Onboarding process offers the following business value:

Reduces Manual Errors
Automating file generation, renaming, and transfer minimizes human mistakes during data entry and processing.

Improves Operational Efficiency
Scheduled jobs and standardized file formats reduce dependency on manual follow-ups and coordination between teams (PSO, EWS, Product).

Accelerates Time to Onboard
Clients are onboarded faster into the AVS system, enabling quicker access to services and revenue generation.

Enhances Transparency and Tracking
Automated response status and conditional logic (success/failure handling) ensure traceability and accountability in the onboarding process.

Supports Compliance and Audit
With systematic file creation, renaming, and storage, the process aligns with compliance and auditing requirements.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
You can attach the following Acceptance Criteria to the Feature or to individual User Stories in Rally:

🔹 AC1: File Generation
Given client details are filled in the provided template,

When the user clicks the "Generate" button,

Then a .TTL file should be generated with the name format {Client_name}.TTL.

🔹 AC2: File Renaming
Given a .TTL file is generated,

When the user completes verification,

Then the file should be renamed to AVS2EWSOnboardFile.txt.

🔹 AC3: File Transfer
Given the renamed file is ready,

When the daily schedule triggers at 01:30 PM EST,

Then the file should be copied to the OCP NAS location and made available to EWS.

🔹 AC4: EWS Response Handling
Given the file is processed by EWS,

When the response is returned by 03:00 AM EST next day,

Then the response should be transferred to Truist and made available for status verification.

🔹 AC5: Success Flow
Given the response status is "Successful",

When the file is verified,

Then the client should be added to the company_enrollment table in the AVS database.

🔹 AC6: Failure Flow
Given the response status is not "Successful",

When the file is verified,

Then the status should be updated to the Product Team for further action.

Give me the intended purpose also 


ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Here's the full breakdown including the Intended Purpose, Business Value, and Acceptance Criteria for the Company Enrollment Onboarding feature in your Rally board:

🎯 Intended Purpose
The purpose of the Company Enrollment Onboarding feature is to establish a standardized, semi-automated workflow for onboarding new client companies into the AVS platform. This includes capturing client details, generating a structured file, transferring it to EWS for validation, and updating client records based on response outcomes. The goal is to minimize manual intervention, reduce processing time, and ensure reliable onboarding into the system.

This process ensures:

Accurate and consistent data intake

Timely onboarding of verified clients

Seamless communication between PSO, EWS, and Product teams

💼 Business Value
Eliminates Redundancy & Human Errors
By using a file generator and automated transfer jobs, the process reduces risk of manual mistakes and rework.

Faster Time-to-Market
Onboarding new clients efficiently allows them quicker access to services, reducing revenue delays.

Improves Inter-team Coordination
Automates handoffs between PSO, EWS, and Product teams through scheduled processes and standard file formats.

Audit-Ready Process
Every step (file creation, renaming, status handling) is traceable and repeatable, aligning with compliance and audit requirements.

Scalability
The approach is scalable across multiple client onboardings without needing additional manual effort.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
🔹 AC1: File Generation
Given client details are filled in the TTS-Boarding File Generator v1.2 - Template,

When the user clicks on Generate,

Then a .TTL file should be created in the format {Client_name}.TTL.

🔹 AC2: File Renaming
Given the .TTL file is created,

When the file is reviewed and confirmed,

Then it should be renamed to AVS2EWSOnboardFile.txt.

🔹 AC3: File Copy to NAS
Given the renamed file exists,

When the daily schedule runs at 01:30 PM EST,

Then it should be copied to the OCP NAS location for EWS processing.

🔹 AC4: EWS Response Processing
Given EWS processes the onboarding file,

When the scheduled CD job runs at 03:00 AM EST,

Then the response should be available for review.

🔹 AC5: Success Path
Given the EWS response is Successful,

Then the client should be added to the AVS Database under the company_enrollment table.

🔹 AC6: Failure Path
Given the EWS response is Not Successful,

Then the onboarding status should be updated and escalated to the Product Team.
